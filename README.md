Here are some of the materials I recommend by topic. I'm from a mathematics background, so take that in consideration when using this. 

There are things that I didn't learn from a specific material or the resource is not available online, so it won't be here. 

Although not listed, in every one of the topics I used Wikipedia, and, in my opinion, it's one of the most useful resources out there.

For programming, I rely mostly on documentation and examples. Forums like 
[stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) can be very helpful too.

For maths, [Proof Wiki](https://proofwiki.org/) is a very nice resource.

Search engines are your friends, use them.
